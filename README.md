# VedioChatTraces
To make the data I collected during my course project publicly available
We collect network traces using android phone during vedio chat on a application called Wechat.
The traces are collected under three different circumstances: Both ends good network connection; Both bad...; One bad and the other one good;
Traces from different end are stored in seperate folders, "LHR" and "HXQ". Three circumstances are denoted using different subfolder name, 3-x, 4-x and 5-x(0 < x < 6).
